# AutoTransQF

The main function AutoTransQF in R is an automatic shifted logarithm function constructed based on three components which are logarithm transformation based on parameter Î², standardization and winsorization, and the evaluation of the transformed vector. ADStatQF and autotransfuncQF are two subfunctions embedded in AutoTransQF.

You may refer to the report attached to see the detailed mechanism and understand the scenarios where the transformation works and fails.

The unit testing files for all three functions are attached.
